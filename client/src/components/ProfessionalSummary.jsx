            I'm a dedicated cybersecurity professional 
            with an Associate's degree and currently 
            working on my Bachelor's. I'm driven to 
            protect organizations from evolving 
            cyber threats with a solid foundation 
            in security principles, network protocols,
             and threat analysis. I excel at identifying 
             vulnerabilities, implementing countermeasures,
              and ensuring data security.

            As an experienced Linux and Unix system 
            administrator, I'm skilled in scripting 
            and automation. I've configured and secured 
            headless systems and scripted in bash, zsh, 
            and PowerShell. My expertise with Azure 
            services, including Virtual Machines and 
            Storage, lets me deploy and manage cloud 
            infrastructure effectively. Passionate about 
            automation and security, I'm always up-to-date 
            with the latest technologies and best practices.
